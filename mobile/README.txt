Game rule
---------
The 501 :
Each player starts with a capital of 501 points. Then launches a set 
of three darts (or less), we add the score of these and subtract the 
result to its capital to be the first at exactly zero (not to exceed).

The 301 :
The rule 301 is the same as the 501 except that the players start the 
game with a score of 301 instead of 501.

The Double Out :
This option adds a difficulty to the game. Indeed, in order to complete
the game, players must launch their last arrow in a « double ».
